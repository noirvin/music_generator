# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal


Dates 3/16-3/25

**Arvin Seifipour**


**Music Generator**


**Is your project New or Old?** New


**Is your project Solo or Team?** Solo


## Description

**This software takes midi file/files as an input, feeds the data into a markovchain, and outputs a generated impression of the sound with respect to music theory/Scales.**

## Challenges I Anticipate

* integrating major and minor scales with markovchain------->I'm gonna talk to my friend, who is a professional musician, to better understand the relationship of notes in scales
* Making a UI
* Extracting data from midi files------>Find library or API that will make it easier


## Skateboard

**Work with libraries/APIs to extract data from midi/audio files to randomly generate a sound, deploy to heroku**


## Bike

**feed the data into a markov chain to generate composition, add crud for each generated track, make it a flask web-app**


## Car

**Music generator works with respect to music theory, possibly generate chords**
**pretty frontend UI*

## Personal Achievement Goals:


### Arvin Seifipour

1. figure out nth order markovchain, so generated composition doesn't sound robotic
2. Integrate music theory with markov to generate chords that sound pleasing to the ear
3. actually make an appealing front-end UI :)
